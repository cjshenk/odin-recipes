        <p>These Crispy Potato skins are topped with smoked bacon, green onions, and plenty of sharp cheddar and Monterey Jack Cheese.  They are easy to prepare and so much better than the restaurants.  This is one of our favorite go-to appetizers and is perfect for football season and entertaining.</p>
        <p>Fall will be here before we know it, and with it comes lots and lots of great appetizers and finger food.  These skins are perfect for game day, family movie night, or kids' sleepovers.  My husband and I love to entertain, and these appetizers, Bacon Wrapped Pineapple, Sausage Rolls, and Jalapeno Popper Cheese Ball are some of our favorites.</p>

        <h2>INSTRUCTIONS</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat oven to 375 degrees</li>
            <li>Scrub, dry and poke the potatoes 8-10 times using the tines of a fork.  Using your hands rub the potatoes with a little canola oil or olive oil and sprinkle generously with salt. Place them on a baking sheet. Bake potatoes for 50-60 minutes or until they are cooked through.  Let them sit until cool enough to handle.</li>
            <li>Preheat oven to 450 degrees. Cut potatoes in half lengthwise.  Using a spoon scoop out the flesh out leaving 1/4 to 1/2 inch around the inside of the skin.
            </li>
            <li>Melt butter in microwave. Whisk in garlic powder and onion powder.  Brush over the tops and bottoms of the potato skins.  Using the same baking sheet that you cooked the potatoes on place in oven for 10 minutes.  Flip and bake for another 10 minutes.</li>
            <li>Top evenly with both cheeses and bacon.  Return to oven for 5 minutes or until cheese is melted. Top with green onions and sour cream (optional). Serve promptly.</li>
