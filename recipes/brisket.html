        <li>2 tsp EACH black pepper, onion powder, mustard powder</li>
        <li>1 tbsp Worcestershire sauce</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Instructions</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>Mix Rub ingredients. Rub all over brisket. If time permits, leave for 30 minutes - 24 hours in the fridge, but I rarely do this.</li>
        <li>Combine BBQ Sauce ingredients in a slow cooker. Mix then add the brisket – squish it in if needed, like I did.</li>
        <li><b>Slow cook </b>in slow cooker for 8 hours (1.5 kg / 3 lb) to 10 hours (2 kg / 4 lb).</li>
        <li>Remove brisket onto a tray.</li>
        <li>Pour liquid in slow cooker into a saucepan. Bring to simmer over medium high heat and reduce until it thickens to a syrup consistency (it thickens more as it cools).</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, drizzle brisket with oil then roast in a 200C/390F oven for 15 minutes until brown spots appear. Remove then baste generously with Sauce, then return to oven for 5 minutes. Remove and baste again, then return to oven for 5 – 10 minutes until it caramelises and looks like the photos. (See note for BBQ option)</li>
        <li>TO SERVE: Slice brisket thinly across the grain and serve with remaining BBQ Sauce. This is terrific served as a meal with sides or piled high onto rolls with Coleslaw as sliders. See Note 3 for more ideas.</li>
