        <h1>Slow Cooker Beef Brisket with BBQ Sauce</h1>

        <p>
            To-die-for Beef Brisket that really makes the most out of this cut of beef! This Slow Cooker brisket is cooked in a simple homemade BBQ sauce until it’s deliciously tender and infused with incredible flavour.  Serve with a side of Coleslaw or Macaroni Salad and steamed corn. Or pile high onto rolls and make sliders!

This is a reader-favourite recipe included by popular demand in my debut cookbook “Dinner”!
