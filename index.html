        <h1>Slow Cooker Beef Brisket with BBQ Sauce</h1>

        <p>
            To-die-for Beef Brisket that really makes the most out of this cut of beef! This Slow Cooker brisket is cooked in a simple homemade BBQ sauce until it’s deliciously tender and infused with incredible flavour.  Serve with a side of Coleslaw or Macaroni Salad and steamed corn. Or pile high onto rolls and make sliders!

This is a reader-favourite recipe included by popular demand in my debut cookbook “Dinner”!

            <li>1 tsp salt</li>
            <li>1/2 tsp black powder</li>  
          </ul>
          <h3>BBQ Sauce:</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>2 garlic cloves-<em> minced</em></li>
            <li>1/2 cup apple cider vinegar</li>
            <li>1 1/2 cups ketchup</li>
            <li>1/2 cup brown sugar</li>
            <li>2 tsp EACH black pepper, onion powder, mustard powder</li>
            <li>1 tbsp Worcestershire sauce</li>
          </ul>
          <h2>Instructions</h2>
          <ol>
            <li>Mix Rub ingredients. Rub all over brisket. If time permits, leave for 30 minutes - 24 hours in the fridge, but I rarely do this.</li>
            <li>Combine BBQ Sauce ingredients in a slow cooker. Mix then add the brisket – squish it in if needed, like I did.</li>
            <li><b>Slow cook </b>in slow cooker for 8 hours (1.5 kg / 3 lb) to 10 hours (2 kg / 4 lb).</li>
            <li>Remove brisket onto a tray.</li>
            <li>Pour liquid in slow cooker into a saucepan. Bring to simmer over medium high heat and reduce until it thickens to a syrup consistency (it thickens more as it cools).</li>
            <li>Meanwhile, drizzle brisket with oil then roast in a 200C/390F oven for 15 minutes until brown spots appear. Remove then baste generously with Sauce, then return to oven for 5 minutes. Remove and baste again, then return to oven for 5 – 10 minutes until it caramelises and looks like the photos. (See note for BBQ option)</li>
            <li>TO SERVE: Slice brisket thinly across the grain and serve with remaining BBQ Sauce. This is terrific served as a meal with sides or piled high onto rolls with Coleslaw as sliders. See Note 3 for more ideas.</li>
